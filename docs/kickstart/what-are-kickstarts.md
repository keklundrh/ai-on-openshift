##  What are AI kickstarts?
Kickstarts are simple, ready-to-use AI examples using Red Hat platforms. 
They are straightforward and focused example use cases - easy to launch, 
easy to get, and ready to go!

AI kickstarts are collected in the 
[AI kickstarts GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rh-ai-kickstart), and 
cataloged here for easy navigation.  
Each repository is a kickstart making it easy for you to get started.
